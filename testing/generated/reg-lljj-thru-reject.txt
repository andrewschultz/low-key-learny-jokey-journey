An invisible pen begins to fill the blank space in the plus plaque. The [sprite] smirks, at first, but then frowns once they see what's really there. 'That's a cheap shot! No! It's too obvious! Why would you? I ... I just get cleverer and cleverer! Or I would, if not for afterlife intrigue and backstabbing and the man keeping down the people with real ideas.' It waves its hand, and you are blown away to shouts of 'Ingrate' and 'Smart-aleck' and so forth.
You tumble down on the sidewalk where you first met the Burning Bright Spurning Sprite. You feel like you learned nothing, and yet, at the same time, you think back to what made you say 'Wow, whoah,' trying to reconstruct that magic moment before you were interrupted. You feel as though your journeys helped piece together parts of it, and there will be other experiences that put a bit more together. You are confident that anything reminding you of [nkhh] will be worth checking out, and you will chip away pieces of the vision you had, and that will be good enough.
