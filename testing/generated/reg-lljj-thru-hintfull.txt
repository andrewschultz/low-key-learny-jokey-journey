>hint
You may notice the TRAIN TREE has writing on it. It's an option that's meaningless for gameplay, but it helps you see what sort of puzzles are ahead. (+)

>hint
You can READ the train tree to decide your name, which has no effect on anything except the hints you may pick up in the next room. (+)

>hint
If you note the names, you may find a bonus point that goes along with the room name and game theme. (-)

>hint me
Look at the location names and title of the story. (+)

>hint me
Read the train tree. (+)

>hint me
Note that there are a lot of rhyme pairs floating around. (+)

>hint me
Your job in this game is to manufacture parallel rhyme pairs. (-)

>hint
The roaring rocks can be changed into something useful and interesting. Or something that contains something interesting. Something that double-rhymes roaring rocks. (+)

>hint
The container itself may not look interesting. (+)

>hint
BORING BOX. (-)

>boring box
by one point

>hint
You can LL and try going UP to look around and get clues about the leet learner here, but there are no more puzzles.

>hint box
You can really only OPEN the boring box.

>open box

>hint learner
The leet learner and its parts only give hints. You can LL alone to scan a room, LL any thing or person, or READ the leet learner to see its option.

>hint monk
You have two ways you need to dispose of the mad monk. (+)

>hint monk
Both ways are a downer, and you may be able to guess words that rhyme with ad. (+)

>hint monk
/You can say (BAD BUNK|SAD SUNK)\.

You hear a whooshing as a door swings in from nowhere. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Voices from behind it, though, assure you you are missing something. Using your logical skills, you deduce it is a miss-more-diss door. While it's not going to jump you if your back is turned, it might be nice to get rid of.
