>bother
You hear a whooshing as a door swings in from nowhere. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Voices from behind it, though, assure you you are missing something. Using your logical skills, you deduce it is a miss-more-diss door. While it's not going to jump you if your back is turned, it might be nice to get rid of.

>crust crack
Under Just Jack's watchful eye, you don't feel like you could precipitate such changes. How to get rid of him?

NOTE: this command will be useful later, but you aren't ready to use it, yet. You can track commands like this by typing THINK, which will also clue you if they now work.

#testcase-think-table-of-verb-checks-vc-crust-crack-rule
>think
You think about more specific challenges you've encountered and not solved, and what you've done and tried, and what you can do.

You need to get rid of Just Jack before you can make the CRUST CRACK.

NOTE: The game will indicate when one command you found early will be applicable. An asterisk or (+) will also appear in the score in the upper right. Until then, you can THINK to see things you figured but aren't quite ready to do yet.
