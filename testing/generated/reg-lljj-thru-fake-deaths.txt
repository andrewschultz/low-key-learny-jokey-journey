You hear a whooshing as a door swings in from nowhere. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Voices from behind it, though, assure you you are missing something. Using your logical skills, you deduce it is a miss-more-diss door. While it's not going to jump you if your back is turned, it might be nice to get rid of.
