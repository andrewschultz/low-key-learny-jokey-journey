Cardinal directions don't mean much here, yet. Besides, there's no way back. You can only just enter the Train Tree one of three ways.

As you go on your way, who should block your way but a fervent Mad Monk? They can't be too tough, this early in the game, especially since their name's seven letters.

The passage here is north-south.

You feel your will sapped as you attempt to go north. You'll need to sit out the storm first.

>bother
You hear a whooshing as a door swings in from nowhere. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Voices from behind it, though, assure you you are missing something. Using your logical skills, you deduce it is a miss-more-diss door. While it's not going to jump you if your back is turned, it might be nice to get rid of.
