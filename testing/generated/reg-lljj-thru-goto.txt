Cardinal directions don't mean much here, yet. Besides, there's no way back. You can only just enter the Train Tree one of three ways.

There are no clear safe exits. It looks like you need to solve a puzzle to find your way out of here.

As you go on your way, who should block your way but a fervent Mad Monk? They can't be too tough, this early in the game, especially since their name's seven letters.

You hear a whooshing as a door swings in from nowhere. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Voices from behind it, though, assure you you are missing something. Using your logical skills, you deduce it is a miss-more-diss door. While it's not going to jump you if your back is turned, it might be nice to get rid of.
