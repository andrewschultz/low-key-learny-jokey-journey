You hear a whooshing as a door swings in from nowhere. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Voices from behind it, though, assure you you are missing something. Using your logical skills, you deduce it is a miss-more-diss door. While it's not going to jump you if your back is turned, it might be nice to get rid of.

#testcase-lift-before-table-of-lift-texts-show-shoe
You wonder if a concert will really take your mind off things. You wonder what things there are to take your mind off. Before you finish wondering, the locking lift drops you by a large amphitheater. Empty, but big enough for a good show.

#testcase-lift-before-table-of-lift-texts-rum-route
You think back to the bad gifts you've received when people said you should be grateful for their consideration. Then you think back to favors people did, just because, and how much they meant. Gawking in each case. You dare to ask for another gift that will make you gawk the right way...

#testcase-lift-before-table-of-lift-texts-slight-sleaze
You wonder there is a way to understand con artistry without becoming one. As you enter the lift, you reflect that you seem to know when someone is pulling your leg, but they always talk you into believing them. How to break that cycle?

Yes, there is still grift to be grokked. Alas, there always will be.

The locking lift lurches again with a shift shocking enough even though you know it's coming...
