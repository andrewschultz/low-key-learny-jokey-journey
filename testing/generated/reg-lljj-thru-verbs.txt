#testcase-mainverbs-check-attacking-if-player-is-in-bane-be-sane-see
>attack tree
READing the tree is a better way to attack getting that first point.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-climbing-if-climb-warn-is-false
#testcase-mainverbs-check-climbing-if-noun-is-train-tree
>climb tree
There's nothing on top of the tree, only inside.
NOTE: CLIMB maps to going up.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-climbing-fallthrough
>climb me
Unclimbable, but you don't really need to climb anything.
!NOTE:

#testcase-mainverbs-check-entering-train-tree-default
>enter tree
You can READ the tree to see which of three ways to enter. There is no right or wrong way.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-opening-train-tree-default
>open tree
The tree's three passages are already open to you.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-singing-default
>sing
You hum a few too-totes-new notes, almost stringing together a wry witty dry ditty.

#testcase-mainverbs-modified-can't-take-scenery-rule-default
>take tree
You don't explicitly need to TAKE anything in Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-swearing-obscenely-if-roaring-rocks-is-unvisited
>shit
Wait until you've moved out of here. Then, cursing will give you a chance for a bonus point.

#ttc-table-of-readables-train-tree
>read train tree
There are three ways to enter the train tree: under writing saying WAYNE (WHEE), JANE G, or DANE D/LANE LEE. You can probably type whichever, to enter as you please.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-listening-if-player-is-in-bane-be-sane-see

You get the feeling your voice could add constructively to the noises, somehow, but it's not critical.

You think you still hear echoes of your plain plea, but it's time to move on.

>boring box
by one point

>open box
You open the boring box, and you see a metal gadget that doesn't look very interesting at first.

#testcase-common-readables-table-of-readables-leet-learner
>read leet learner
The leet learner has three toggles: HA HALF (on) and NAH NAFF (off) to note when you are half right. It's currently on. TWO TOO (on) and DO DUE (off) is for homonym detection.
One slider setting has a range of values: GO GUESS to LO LESS to YO YES to the most information-giving entry, MO MESS. It's currently set to LO LESS, which means you'll only get information on how many things you need to sort out with the current double-rhyme.
You can HINT LL to see what they all mean.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-attacking-if-noun-is-mad-monk
>attack mad monk
That would be, um, mad.

#testcase-mainverbs-carry-out-talktoing-fallthrough
>t leet learner
No response. There's not a lot you need to talk to.

#testcase-mainverbs-carry-out-talktoing-if-noun-is-mad-monk
>t mad monk

You need more pointed commentary, picking out the mad monk's flaws.

#testcase-mainverbs-carry-out-swear-swamp-where-womping-repeat-through-table-of-verb-checks-if-check-rule-entry-is-vc-piss-poor-rule
>swear swamp where womp
You bypass any form of profanity, and the unsummoned miss-more-diss door, to remain above that sort of thing and gain a bonus point for your efforts. You'd have done so even if a bonus point weren't at stake.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-swearing-obscenely-if-miss-more-diss-door-is-off-stage
#testcase-mainverbs-check-swearing-mildly-default

>bother
You hear a whooshing as a door swings in from nowhere. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Voices from behind it, though, assure you you are missing something. Using your logical skills, you deduce it is a miss-more-diss door. While it's not going to jump you if your back is turned, it might be nice to get rid of.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-swearing-obscenely-fallthrough
>x diss door
#game text is not as important as the diss door being there
It seems to be inviting you in, and yet, at the same time, pushing you away for not being quite good enough. Yet.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-entering-miss-more-diss-door-default
>enter diss door
Looking for arguments right now is pointless.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-swearing-obscenely-if-miss-more-diss-door-is-fungible

The miss-more-diss door rattles a menacing challenge.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-swearing-obscenely-if-miss-more-diss-door-is-moot

With the miss-more-diss door gone, a worst-word-burst bird flies by and puts your efforts to utter shame.

#+testcase-mainverbs-check-swearing-obscenely-if-miss-more-diss-door-is-moot

With the miss-more-diss door gone, another worst-word-burst bird flies by and puts your efforts to utter shame.

#testcase-mainverbs-carry-out-talktoing-if-noun-is-free-fruit

#testcase-mainverbs-check-eating-if-noun-is-pear-peach
>eat pear peach
It looks good to eat, but it must have a higher purpose. Besides, you're not hungry.

#testcase-mainverbs-check-eating-fallthrough

You need only spiritual sustenance, not physical, in Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey.

The crow crew has its own prep for the performance. You feel even asking them if they were ready would make them less ready. It's the crowd that you need to interact with.
