#ttc-table-of-bane-be-sane-see-guesses-cane-key
>cane key
You don't need any key to unlock the tree.

#ttc-table-of-bane-be-sane-see-guesses-feign-fee
>feign fee
You whine about how Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey costs money on top of being a waste of time. Nobody listens.

#ttc-table-of-bane-be-sane-see-guesses-main-me
>main me
You are the main character in this adventure, but don't let it go to your head.

#ttc-table-of-bane-be-sane-see-guesses-pain-p-pee
>pain p
Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey is nonviolent and hopefully devoid of bathroom humor.

You come to grips with how you are not as humble as you should be.

>okie ernie
No stereotypical rural fellow pops up with down-home advice.

#ttc-table-of-general-good-guesses-tokey-tourney
>tokey tourney
That could potentially be very relaxed and low-key, indeed. I guess.

#ttc-table-of-lurking-lump-guesses-clerking-clump
>clerking clump
The lump can't keep track of things. That would be the Leet Learner.

#ttc-table-of-lurking-lump-guesses-perking-pump

I don't want to know.

#ttc-table-of-roaring-rocks-guesses-flooring-flocks
>flooring flocks
You don't need to be dive-bombed by aerial predators. And I don't have the artistic ability to show you majestic birds, either. Sorry.

#ttc-table-of-roaring-rocks-guesses-poring-pouring-pox
>pouring pox
You don't need to catch anything, and denting the rocks would not reveal anything.

#ttc-table-of-roaring-rocks-guesses-storing-stocks
>storing stocks
That's what the rocks will become, but you want something simpler and smaller and shorter.

You don't need to catch anything, and denting the rocks would not reveal anything further.

#ttc-table-of-no-nudge-slow-sludge-guesses-fo-foe-fudge
>foe fudge
This isn't Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Err, Charlie's.

#ttc-table-of-no-nudge-slow-sludge-guesses-joe-judge
>joe judge
No former New York Giants head football coach appears.

#ttc-table-of-no-nudge-slow-sludge-guesses-po-poe-pudge

Weight gain won't help here.

There's a useful item here. More useful than such words!

#ttc-table-of-trust-track-guesses-lust-lack
>lust lack
Jack would still be bugging you in that state.

#ttc-table-of-trust-track-guesses-rust-rack

That would be a useless item.

#ttc-table-of-trust-track-guesses-must-mack

You don't need memories of Just Jack.

#+ttc-table-of-trust-track-guesses-cussed-cack

No, the sack will be worthwhile.

#+ttc-table-of-trust-track-guesses-lust-lack
>lust lack
You continue to put impure thoughts aside to focus on a really cool text adventure.

#ttc-table-of-deep-dune-guesses-beep-boon
>beep boon
No, you don't a Geiger counter to search through the dune.

#ttc-table-of-deep-dune-guesses-creep-croon
>creep croon
Alas, R. Kelly can't show up. He's still in jail.

#ttc-table-of-deep-dune-guesses-leap-loon
>leap loon
Alas, nobody odd comes by and dives into the deep dune. Nobody at all.

#ttc-table-of-deep-dune-guesses-peep-poon
>peep poon
Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey is the wrong environment for that, and not just because it's text-based.

>one worm
That doesn't quite work. Maybe the farm needs worms or warm weather, but its survival isn't as important to you as passage north.
