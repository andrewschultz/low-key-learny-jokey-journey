That could potentially be very relaxed and low-key, indeed. I guess.

You don't need to be dive-bombed by aerial predators. And I don't have the artistic ability to show you majestic birds, either. Sorry.

#ttc-table-of-roaring-rocks-guesses-poring-pouring-pox
>pouring pox
You don't need to catch anything, and denting the rocks would not reveal anything.

#ttc-table-of-roaring-rocks-guesses-storing-stocks

That's what the rocks will become, but you want something simpler and smaller and shorter.

You find no ballot or part thereof.

#ttc-table-of-mad-monk-guesses-clad-clunk

#ttc-table-of-mad-monk-guesses-dad-dunk
>dad dunk
Alas, no middle-aged man soars into the air, basketball in hand, to posterize the mad monk.

#ttc-table-of-mad-monk-guesses-fad-funk
>fad funk
Falling prey to fashion is not one of the mad monk's vices. They're more about violence and intimidation.

#ttc-table-of-mad-monk-guesses-grad-grunk
>grad grunk
The mad monk fails to look for a lost pig or learn anything.

#ttc-table-of-mad-monk-guesses-had-hunk
>had hunk
You try to claim the mad monk has lost muscle, but the insult doesn't really land, because with age comes wisdom, and stuff.

#ttc-table-of-mad-monk-guesses-lad-lunk
>lad lunk
Both insults are a bit too trivial to land.

#ttc-table-of-mad-monk-guesses-pad-punk

You wouldn't want to instill strict morals on this place. Or deny Mr. Peterson an extension of his bar tab.

>bother
You hear a whooshing as a door swings in from nowhere. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Voices from behind it, though, assure you you are missing something. Using your logical skills, you deduce it is a miss-more-diss door. While it's not going to jump you if your back is turned, it might be nice to get rid of.

#ttc-table-of-miss-more-diss-door-guesses-chiz-chore
>chiz chore
You briefly get your Nigel Molesworth on.

>be bunk
You crave neither a tall bed nor outright lies.

#ttc-table-of-thunk-tree-trunk-guesses-de-dunk

Your mind flashes back to an 80s-era DePaul basketball commercial. Okay, maybe it doesn't, but mine did when I thought of this.

#ttc-table-of-thunk-tree-trunk-guesses-fee-phi-funk
>fee funk
You try to monetize or formulate olfactory and/or musical funkiness but fail.

#ttc-table-of-thunk-tree-trunk-guesses-flee-flunk

Aw, c'mon, you've gotten pretty far. You shouldn't need to run in shame.

The landscape stays its own form of surreal.

Micturation is unnecessary to complete Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey.

# possible extra LLP if no plain plea, then visit here -- this would be at the very end, in a non-main-thru script ??

#ttc-table-of-thunk-tree-trunk-guesses-plea-plunk

The time for a plea that landed for a bonus point is passed, and you took it.

#ttc-table-of-thunk-tree-trunk-guesses-ski-skunk

The weather is not cold enough, and there's no snow.

#ttc-table-of-free-fruit-guesses-gee-jute
>gee jute
No, there's actual fruit inside.

#ttc-table-of-free-fruit-guesses-glee-glute
>glee glute
You pat yourself on the back for eating so much fruit to keep your stomach in shape.

#ttc-table-of-free-fruit-guesses-he-hee-hoot
>hee hoot
You make a small show of being grateful for the prospect of free fruit. But you may need to be more demonstrative.

#ttc-table-of-free-fruit-guesses-key-coot
>key coot
No animal appears to unlock the free fruit.

#ttc-table-of-free-fruit-guesses-me-moot

Do not dismiss your importance.

#ttc-table-of-free-fruit-guesses-pee-poot
>pee poot
A good guess, technically, I suppose.

#ttc-table-of-free-fruit-guesses-re-root
>re root
The free fruit dispenser is not broken. No need to start it up again.

#ttc-table-of-free-fruit-guesses-ski-scoot
>ski scoot
You can just walk to get around.

#ttc-table-of-free-fruit-guesses-tea-toot-tout
>tea tout
Perhaps the tea would be fruit-flavored and refreshing, but it wouldn't be useful.
You probably want to figure what free fruit there is now. Perhaps traveling some more will suggest something.

>pear peach
The FREE FRUIT sputters a bit, almost as if it sticks its tongue out at you. Weird as it sounds, you may have to show appreciation for it.

>tea tout
Perhaps the tea would be fruit-flavored and refreshing, but it wouldn't be useful.
In fact, it looks like you already guessed what the hybrid free fruit is elsewhere. Perhaps a look around would help you recall what you guessed.

#ttc-table-of-rare-reach-guesses-chair-cher-cheech

I couldn't get R. Kelly or Robin Thicke to appear here. Sorry!

The dune would not be stable enough for wild animals like that to make a home.

Alas, nobody odd comes by and dives into the deep dune to help you find what's there. Nobody at all.

Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey is the wrong environment for that, and not just because it's text-based.
