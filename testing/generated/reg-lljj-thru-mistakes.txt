No policemen drive by. They might be corrupt, anyway.

#ttc-table-of-general-good-guesses-mopping-mart

Surely this is more exciting than a trip for cleaning supplies.

Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey is nonviolent and hopefully devoid of bathroom humor.

You don't need to be dive-bombed by aerial predators. And I don't have the artistic ability to show you majestic birds, either. Sorry.

#ttc-table-of-roaring-rocks-guesses-poring-pouring-pox

You don't need to catch anything, and denting the rocks would not reveal anything.

#ttc-table-of-mad-monk-guesses-dad-dunk
>dad dunk
Alas, no middle-aged man soars into the air, basketball in hand, to posterize the mad monk.

#ttc-table-of-mad-monk-guesses-fad-funk
>fad funk
Falling prey to fashion is not one of the mad monk's vices. They're more about violence and intimidation.

>grad grunk
The mad monk fails to look for a lost pig or learn anything.

#ttc-table-of-mad-monk-guesses-had-hunk

You hear a whooshing as a door swings in from nowhere. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Voices from behind it, though, assure you you are missing something. Using your logical skills, you deduce it is a miss-more-diss door. While it's not going to jump you if your back is turned, it might be nice to get rid of.

#ttc-table-of-miss-more-diss-door-guesses-chiz-chore

You crave neither a tall bed nor outright lies.

#ttc-table-of-thunk-tree-trunk-guesses-de-dunk

Your mind flashes back to an 80s-era DePaul basketball commercial. Okay, maybe it doesn't, but mine did when I thought of this.

#ttc-table-of-thunk-tree-trunk-guesses-fee-phi-funk
>fee funk
You try to monetize or formulate olfactory and/or musical funkiness but fail.

#ttc-table-of-thunk-tree-trunk-guesses-flee-flunk

Aw, c'mon, you've gotten pretty far. You shouldn't need to run in shame.

Micturation is unnecessary to complete Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey.

# possible extra LLP if no plain plea, then visit here -- this would be at the very end, in a non-main-thru script ??

#ttc-table-of-thunk-tree-trunk-guesses-plea-plunk

You suspect some small stuff or other is around.
