}$REJECT=I couldn't parse that command. You don't need any more than two words long.
}$REJECT2=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey has eliminated a lot of them, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$GREENBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$GREENCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green.
}$YELLOWBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$YELLOWCOREFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow--one of the words must work for a future solution.
}$YELLOWCORE=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up yellow.

}}MAX=86
}}CURMAX=86
}}SCORE=0
}}CURMIN=72
}}CURMINBONUS=0

}$SCOS=You have scored a total of {SCORE} out of {MAX} points and need {CURMIN} to win. You have found {CURMIN} of {MAXBONUS} optional points so far.
}$MISSINGONE=1 optional point is no longer available.
}$MISSING={} optional points are no longer available.

There's nothing on top of the tree, only inside.

Unclimbable, but you don't really need to climb anything.
!NOTE:
\\
#testcase-mainverbs-check-entering-train-tree-default
>enter tree
You can READ the tree to see which of three ways to enter. There is no right or wrong way.
\\

The tree's three passages are already open to you.
\\

>hint
You may notice the TRAIN TREE has writing on it. It's an option that's meaningless for gameplay, but it helps you see what sort of puzzles are ahead. (+)
\\
>hint
You can READ the train tree to decide your name, which has no effect on anything except the hints you may pick up in the next room. (+)
\\
>hint
If you note the names, you may find a bonus point that goes along with the room name and game theme. (-)
\\
#testcase-rules-hint-player-rule-fallthrough
>hint me
Look at the location names and title of the story. (+)
\\
>hint me
Read the train tree. (+)
\\
>hint me
Note that there are a lot of rhyme pairs floating around. (+)
\\
>hint me
Your job in this game is to manufacture parallel rhyme pairs. (-)

@ver
#ttc-table-of-readables-train-tree
>read train tree
There are three ways to enter the train tree: under writing saying WAYNE (WHEE), JANE G, or DANE D/LANE LEE. You can probably type whichever, to enter as you please.

@gong
>guide gong
You are now repelled by a guide gong if you try to go down a path where you have nothing game-critical to do in any branches.

@prong
>pride prong
You are now blocked from paths where no branches contain any point-scoring activities, critical or bonus.

@hom
>two too
You've tried an option you can't exercise until you get a hint item. You should, shortly.

One slider setting has a range of values: GO GUESS to LO LESS to YO YES to the most information-giving entry, MO MESS. It's currently set to LO LESS, which means you'll only get information on how many things you need to sort out with the current double-rhyme.
