#--strict-file: this says that the project requires strict section marking e.g. @all instead of ==t1.

}$REJECT=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, this game tries to keep it simple, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. But VERBS will show what you can use.

/^Bane Be Sane, See?

@ver
>listen
You get the feeling your voice could add constructively to the noises, somehow, but it's not critical.

@!min

by one point

@ver
>listen
You still think you hear echoes of your plain plea.

@gt
>gt tree
DEBUG: train tree is in Bane Be Sane, See?, so gotoing there.
You're already there! Well, here.
\\
>gt bane
You're already there! Well, here.
\\
>n
Cardinal directions don't mean much here, yet. Besides, there's no way back. You can only just enter the Train Tree one of three ways.

/^Roaring Rocks

@ver
>listen
"Poring Pox!" the roaring rocks, uh, roar.

@gt
>n
The roaring seems to pull you back.
\\

The rocks block every way except north.
\\
>e
The rocks block every way except north.
\\

The rocks block every way except north.
\\

There's no way back to where you started.

/^No-Nudge Slow Sludge

@ver

Quite quiet site. Sigh, it ...

@gt
>w
The no-nudge slow sludge slows you up, which makes you mad, but not mad enough to trek through it.
\\
>n
The no-nudge slow sludge slows you up, which makes you mad, but not mad enough to trek through it.

/^Trust Track

@thi
>crust crack
Under Just Jack's watchful eye, you don't feel like you could precipitate such changes. How to get rid of him?
\\
NOTE: this command will be useful later, but you aren't ready to use it, yet. You can track commands like this by typing THINK, which will also clue you if they now work.
\\
>think
You think about more specific challenges you've encountered and not solved, and what you've done and tried, and what you can do.
\\
You need to get rid of Just Jack before you can make the CRUST CRACK.
\\
NOTE: The game will indicate when one command you found early will be applicable. An asterisk or (+) will also appear in the score in the upper right. Until then, you can THINK to see things you figured but aren't quite ready to do yet.

The track seems to end here. You can really only go back west, unless you figure something out.

The track now runs west-south but not north.

The track now runs west-south but not east.

@thi
>think
You think about more specific challenges you've encountered and not solved, and what you've done and tried, and what you can do.

But you don't have leads for any puzzles right now.
