}$REJECT=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, this game tries to keep it simple, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. But VERBS will show what you can use.

Cardinal directions don't mean much here, yet. Besides, there's no way back. You can only just enter the Train Tree one of three ways.

Some text matches up with where the needle nose might spin. It's a bit of a stretch, in some cases, but you figure the more help the better.
CONCEIT CONCERNER is written to the left.
  CHEAT CHURNER   is written to the center-left.
   MEET MOURNER   is written to the center.
   BEAT BURNER    is written to the center-right.
    EAT EARNER    is written to the right.

Under Just Jack's watchful eye, you don't feel like you could precipitate such changes. How to get rid of him?
\\
NOTE: this command will be useful later, but you aren't ready to use it, yet. You can track commands like this by typing THINK, which will also clue you if they now work.
\\
>think
You think about more specific challenges you've encountered and not solved, and what you've done and tried, and what you can do.
\\
You need to get rid of Just Jack before you can make the CRUST CRACK.
\\
NOTE: The game will indicate when one command you found early will be applicable. An asterisk or (+) will also appear in the score in the upper right. Until then, you can THINK to see things you figured but aren't quite ready to do yet.
