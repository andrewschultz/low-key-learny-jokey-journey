}$REJECT2=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey has eliminated a lot of them, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.

You may notice the TRAIN TREE has writing on it. It's an option that's meaningless for gameplay, but it helps you see what sort of puzzles are ahead. (+)

You can READ the train tree to decide your name, which has no effect on anything except the hints you may pick up in the next room. (+)
