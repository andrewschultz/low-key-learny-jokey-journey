# low-key-learny-jokey-journey
IFComp 2022 entrant

This contains code for LLJJ as well as a prospective 2022 EctoComp games to be named on October 30.

The PPRR E34\* contains code for that fourth game.

There are some PPRR\*.i7x files in the Very Vile Fairy File repo at https://github.com/andrewschultz/very-vile-fairy-file.

This game just sneaks into the z-code format in debug mode. I made a concentrated effort to keep it streamlined, so there are no fun random notes as in VVFF.

It also experiments with a hub structure where you must do several things in one room.
