# Low-Key Learny Jokey Journey
IFComp 2022 entrant

This contains code for LLJJ as well as a prospective 2022 EctoComp game to be named on October 30.

The PPRR E34\*.i7x files contain code for that fourth game.

There are some PPRR\*.i7x files in the Very Vile Fairy File repo at https://github.com/andrewschultz/very-vile-fairy-file. They are needed to build the code or, if you want, understand what the code does. I use the 6G60 version to compile.

Trivial Niceties.i7x is available from my miscellaneous repository: https://github.com/andrewschultz/miscellany.

This game just sneaks into the z-code format in debug mode. I made a concentrated effort to keep it streamlined, so there are no fun random notes as in VVFF.

It also experiments with a hub structure where you must do several things in one room.
